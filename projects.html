            </h4>
            <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-size:14px; color:black;">
                This project involves developing a Python script that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest paths within a given rail network. The algorithm calculates the shortest path from a specified starting station to all other stations in the network. Dijkstra's algorithm is an efficient method for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, particularly when all edge weights are non-negative.
